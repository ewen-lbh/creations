A CLI to manage what you create
v0.0.0

ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

== This project isn't dead
I'm currently working hard on my https://ewen.works[portfolio] because I need to get it done.
As soon as it is finished, I will go back to working on `creations` and https://www.schoolsyst.com[schoolsyst]

== Installation

Install the command globally:
```console
# yarn
$ yarn global add creations
# npm
$ npm i -g creations
```

== Configuration

You'll want to define your types of creations.
`creations` commes with one type of creation prefedefined: `creations-template`.
This will assist you in creating your creations templates more quickly.

For a complete how-to on configuration, see <<docs/CONFIGURING#,CONFIGURING>>.
